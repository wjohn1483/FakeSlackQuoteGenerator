# FakeSlackQuoteGenerator

This repository was originated from [HoldenA1/FakeSlackQuoteGenerator](https://github.com/HoldenA1/FakeSlackQuoteGenerator).

Its demo web can be found from [here](https://holdena1.github.io/FakeSlackQuoteGenerator/).

I modified the source code a little bit to let the user able to specify the time and use line breaks.

You can also use **./generate_fake_quote.py** to generate multiple fake quotes automatically.
